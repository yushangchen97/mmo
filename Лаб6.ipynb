gouging companies with\\ntaxpayer money . since 75 % of californians currently blame the utilities and\\nthe puc for this crisis ( and only 10 % blame davis ) , this is a crucial\\npolitical stance for the governor .\\nbut , of course , absorbing anything like $ 6 billion in debt would be quite a\\nshock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power - generating branches\\nof the two utilities , and they began spreading the word that they were quite\\nwilling to accept bankruptcy . thus by mid - week , both\\nsides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court\\nthat would be a worst case solution for all sides : the country \\' s economy\\nwould\\nsuffer from the resulting credit shock , the governor \\' s political future would\\nsuffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a\\nbankruptcy judge , while most private sector legal authorities believe the\\nutilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during\\nbankruptcy\\nprocedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of\\nthe debt in the end . in addition , they would most likely face a state\\ngovernment\\ndetermined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in\\na major way .\\nsenator burton \\' s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically\\nto make this point quite explicit . it would set up a \" california power and\\nconservation\\nfinancing authority , \" with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent\\ndomain . it would finance new power plants , and \" consider the feasibility and\\npublic\\ninterest of the state acquiring , operating , and maintaining transmission\\nfacilities currently owned by investor - owned and municipal utilities . \"\\nas we write this , all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the\\nbankruptcy ledge to safe ground , and there is no question the tone has\\nshifted\\nin the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to \" maybe we \\' ve run this thing\\nout as far as we can . \" but as we have noted , the chance for miscalculation is\\nstill quite high . there is no solution agreed to at this time , the stand - off\\nover how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities \\'\\nholding\\ncompany is continuing , and the technical fact of default still makes it\\npossible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate\\naccelerated payment .\\n5 . default update - thursday\\nsocal edison - $ 215 million default to california power exchange .\\nafter edison failed to make a $ 215 m electricity payment yesterday , the\\ncalifornia power authority began seizing long - term contacts and reselling\\nthem to recoup some of the money owed to generators . pg & e said it expects\\nits trading privileges at the cal . power authority to be suspended today ,\\nleaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources .\\nwhile the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg & e \\' s and socal \\' s\\nability to buy power , the department of water and resources will be able to\\npick up some of the slack , at least in the very short - term .\\nthe state itself may be getting into risky credit territory . the proposed\\ncalifornia public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of $ 1 . 3\\nbillion from the state general fund in advance of this year \\' s expected fiscal\\nsurplus , with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future\\nrevenues . with near - bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes , it is\\nunclear where the revenues would come from . the amount borrowed and terms of\\nrepayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating\\nagencies .\\n5 . bush policies\\nas we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate\\nlittle interest in getting involved in the california crisis .\\npresident - elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments ,\\nwhich essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root\\nof the current supply shortage . bush and his top officials appear to be\\nunanimously opposed to long - term price caps .\\nhowever , there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration ,\\naccording to a source close to a top bush economic advisor . there is\\nsignificant concern that pg & e \\' s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to\\nstop shipments of gas through pg & e \\' s pipeline . the risk would be that the\\npipeline could \" go dry \" , causing significant and possibly dangerous\\ndisruptions in california residences and businesses . to prevent this\\nproblem , bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg & e into separate\\ngas and electric companies . the gas company would be solvent , but the\\nelectric company would go immediately into ch . 11 following significant\\ndefaults .']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"q7ApdFLRZ0ON","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1621700125330,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":289,"user":{"displayName":"zhibo zhang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh8_y4pfqR32K5ts_cWnnNmRU9hz13PqIdespQy=s64","userId":"09431813280733956316"}}},"source":["def VectorizeAndClassify(vectorizers_list, classifiers_list):\n","    for v in vectorizers_list:\n","        for c in classifiers_list:\n","            pipeline1 = Pipeline([(\"vectorizer\", v), (\"classifier\", c)])\n","            score = cross_val_score(pipeline1, train_df['Message'], train_df['Spam/Ham'], scoring='accuracy', cv=3).mean()\n","            print('Векторизация -
